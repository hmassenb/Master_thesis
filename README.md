# Master_thesis

Plan: 
1. Get feeling for data and categorize Job description, NACE... (and theory oc)

2. Matching(s)
2.1 Match on Ses, NACE. T = 3rd educ, C = no 3rd educ

3. Use matched samples to estimate expectation to work in industry 4.0 (probit, logit or what else i find)

4. Heterogeneity analyis and what else pops up (subgroup within higher educ certain fields of educ (would require matching on higher educ level and create T/C between certain disciplines), between countries..)
